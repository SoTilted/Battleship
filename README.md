# Battleship
Made a classic game called Battleship while going through The Odin Project.
I used jest for testing the classes file.
Implemented drag and drop and to make it responsive for touch screen i used
Berardo-Castilho DragDropTouch file. (https://bernardo-castilho.github.io/DragDropTouch/)

# TODO:
Clean up parts of the code.

Add a rules link for anyone living under a rock.

Make the computer a bit smarter, meaning it should hit adjecent coordinates when it hets a "hit".

Update drag and drop so that instead of having a remove last ship button, you can still change the position of the ships by dragging it around.

Polish the front end part, maybe add ship pngs instead of boxes.
